## Business Model Decision

### Pricing Structure

| Plan           | Price    | Features                           |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Free**       | $0       | ALL features, with quantity limits |
| **Enterprise** | $5/month | ALL features, UNLIMITED            |

### Quantity Limits (Free Tier)

| Limit Type               | Free | Enterprise  |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ----------- |
| Active Brackets          | 3    | ∞ Unlimited |
| Participants per Bracket | 16   | ∞ Unlimited |
| Tournaments per Month    | 2    | ∞ Unlimited |

### Philosophy
- Free users get the FULL experience, not a crippled version
- Upgrade trigger is quantity, not features
- $5/month is "coffee money" — low barrier, volume-based business model
- All features work the same in both tiers

## Session Summary

### Creative Achievements
- **100 breakthrough ideas** generated for TKD bracket SaaS
- **20 organized categories** identifying key opportunity areas
- **Clear pricing model** established (Free + $5 Enterprise)
- **Technical architecture** defined (Flutter Web + Supabase)
- **MVP scope** prioritized for 10-week development

### Key Insights
1. **TKD-specific features are the moat** — generic tools can't easily replicate division builders and dojang separation
2. **Live realtime updates are the "wow" factor** — differentiates from static PDF brackets
3. **$5/month with full features in Free** — generous model drives adoption and easy conversions
4. **Desktop-first is the right call** — organizers work on laptops, brackets are horizontal

### Breakthrough Moments
- Realizing BracketHQ is the perfect model to follow, with TKD specialization as differentiator
- The insight that Free should have ALL features, just with quantity limits
- Understanding that Supabase enables the entire architecture without custom backend
