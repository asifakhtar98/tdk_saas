# UX Design Specification - TKD Brackets

**Author:** Asak
**Date:** 2026-01-30

---

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision

**TKD Brackets** transforms tournament bracket creation from a 2+ hour spreadsheet nightmare into a 5-minute, stress-free experience. It's a **vertical SaaS** that takes the generic bracket tool market (BracketHQ, Challonge) and deeply specializes for Taekwondo, embedding domain knowledge that generic tools cannot replicate.

**Core Value Proposition:**
> The "Aha! Moment" is when a tournament organizer creates their first complete bracket (8+ participants) in under 5 minutes — with proper TKD-specific seeding, dojang separation, and professional PDF output — all with zero manual configuration.

**Platform:** Flutter Web, Desktop-only (landscape browser optimization)
**Technology:** Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)

### Target Users

| Persona              | Role                 | Tech Level | Primary Goal                                 | Device                | UX Priority                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Master Kim**       | Tournament Organizer | Moderate   | Create brackets fast, run smooth tournaments | Desktop laptop        | Primary — all design decisions optimize for this user |
| **Mrs. Rodriguez**   | Volunteer Scorer     | Low        | Enter scores correctly without confusion     | Desktop at ring table | High — zero training requirement                      |
| **David Chen**       | Spectator (Parent)   | Moderate   | Track child's matches in real-time           | Mobile phone          | Medium — view-only, polished experience               |
| **Federation Admin** | Enterprise Customer  | High       | Multi-tournament management                  | Desktop               | Future — power user features                          |

**Key User Insights:**

- **Primary users are NOT tech-savvy** — martial arts instructors, not software people
- **Time pressure is real** — setup happens night before, adjustments at 8:45 AM tournament day
- **Volunteers need zero training** — parent helpers with 2 minutes of instruction
- **Mobile is view-only** — no editing on phones, but spectators want to follow along
- **Professional appearance matters** — PDFs represent the dojang's professionalism

---

### Key Design Challenges

#### 1. Complexity Hiding
*The system handles complex TKD rules (WT/ITF/ATA federations, weight classes, dojang separation) but users must feel it's simple.*

- Smart Division Builder must feel like "magic" — not configuration
- Federation templates eliminate decision fatigue
- Advanced options for power users, hidden by default

#### 2. Keyboard-First Scoring at Speed
*Scorers enter results quickly during live matches with minimal training.*

- No mouse hunting during fast-paced sparring
- Tab/Enter flow must be intuitive
- Undo must be instant and obvious (mistakes happen under pressure)

#### 3. Tournament Day Resilience
*The "oh no" moments (no-shows at 8:45 AM) must feel recoverable, not catastrophic.*

- Clear recovery paths for bracket modifications
- Visual confidence indicators ("this change affects 3 matches")
- No accidental destructive actions

#### 4. Desktop-First BUT Mobile-Friendly Viewing
*Primary editing is desktop-only, but spectators need a usable read-only experience.*

- Two distinct experiences rather than "responsive compromise"
- Mobile viewers shouldn't see edit controls they can't use

## Core User Experience

### Defining Experience

**Core User Action:**
> "Create a complete, properly-seeded TKD bracket from a roster of athletes in one click."

**The Core Loop:**
```
Import Athletes → Configure Division → Generate Bracket → Score Matches → Export Results
        ↑                                                                      ↓
        ←←←←←←←←←←←←← (Next Tournament) ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

**Critical "Must Nail" Interactions:**

| Interaction                | Why It's Critical                            | Success Metric                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-Signup Demo**        | Builds trust before commitment               | User sees working bracket without account |
| **Smart Division Builder** | TKD magic — competitors sorted automatically | Feels instant, zero manual sorting        |
| **One-Click Generation**   | The payoff moment after setup                | < 500ms (progressive render for 64+)      |
| **No-Show Recovery**       | Tournament day chaos moment                  | 30-second fix, no stress                  |
| **Score Entry**            | High-frequency action during live event      | Keyboard-only, < 5 seconds per match      |

---

### Platform Strategy

| Aspect               | Decision                       | Rationale                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Primary View**     | Desktop landscape (1280px+)    | Tournament organizers use laptops    |
| **Input Method**     | Mouse + Keyboard               | Keyboard-first for scoring speed     |
| **Mobile Support**   | View-only experience           | Spectators track matches, no editing |
| **Offline Strategy** | Graceful degradation with sync | Full offline-first is Growth feature |
| **Browser Support**  | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge  | Cover 95%+ of desktop users          |

**Flutter Web Considerations:**
- Optimize for low-end Chromebooks (common in school gyms)
- Service worker for basic caching; full PWA is Growth scope
- Progressive rendering for large brackets (64+ participants)

---

### Effortless Interactions

#### 1. Pre-Signup Demo
> "I saw it work before I even created an account"

- Sample roster with realistic TKD names (not "Player 1")
- Interactive bracket — zoom, pan, click matches
- Converts skeptics by demonstrating value first

#### 2. Athlete Import
> "Paste from spreadsheet → Athletes appear sorted"

- Auto-detect columns with fallback UI for manual mapping
- Handle Excel hidden characters gracefully
- Smart matching for belt naming variations

#### 3. Division Assignment
> "System knows TKD — no explaining needed"

- Pre-loaded WT/ITF/ATA templates
- Athletes auto-sort into correct divisions
- Edge cases highlighted with suggestions

#### 4. Bracket Generation
> "One click. Done."

- Dojang separation automatic
- Optimal bye placement
- Progressive rendering for large brackets

#### 5. Score Entry
> "Tab. Type. Enter. Done."

- Current match highlighted
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Undo is always Ctrl+Z

---

### Critical Success Moments

#### Success Moment 0: Pre-Signup "Aha!"
*"I didn't even have an account yet and I already saw it work"*

- Interactive demo with sample TKD data
- User sees bracket generation magic before committing
- Trust built through demonstration, not promises

#### Success Moment 1: First Bracket Creation
*"60 seconds from signup to seeing MY bracket"*

- No upfront configuration
- Account creation after seeing value

#### Success Moment 2: Smart Division Builder Magic
*"I pasted my roster and it just sorted everyone correctly"*

- System demonstrates domain knowledge immediately
- No other tool does this — it's the moat

#### Success Moment 3: Tournament Morning Recovery
*"Three kids no-showed and I fixed all brackets in 2 minutes"*

- Calm, clear recovery flow
- User feels in control

#### Success Moment 4: Professional Output
*"Parents thought we hired a professional company"*

- PDFs look official
- Venue display mode impresses spectators

---

### Experience Principles

#### 1. Value Before Signup
> "Show, don't tell — prove we work before asking for commitment."

- Interactive demo with realistic sample data
- User experiences the "aha moment" pre-registration
- Trust through demonstration beats marketing promises

#### 2. Domain Intelligence First
> "The system knows TKD, so users don't have to explain anything."

- Use TKD terminology natively (dojang, not "team")
- Smart defaults based on federation rules
- Eliminate all "generic bracket tool" friction

#### 3. Speed Over Features
> "Fast and simple beats powerful and complex."

- Optimize for the 90% case, hide the 10%
- One click accomplishes what competitors need five
- Everything feels instant

#### 4. Keyboard-First for Power
> "Scorers never touch the mouse during live matches."

- Tab/Enter flow for all data entry
- Shortcuts for common actions
- Mouse available but never required

#### 5. Autosave Everything, Undo Anything
> "Nothing is ever lost, nothing is permanent until you say so."

- Autosave every 5 seconds
- Complete undo stack for all actions
- Graceful degradation when offline (queue + sync)
- Full offline-first is Growth feature, not MVP

---

### Design Opportunities

#### 1. "Instant Gratification" First Experience
- Pre-signup interactive demo
- Shareworthy moment before account creation

#### 2. The "Anti-Excel" Visual Language
- Everything spreadsheets do badly, we do beautifully
- Animations provide clarity (winner advancing is visual, not just data)

#### 3. Contextual Intelligence
- Smart suggestions ("7 competitors — single elimination with one bye recommended")

#### 4. Venue Display Mode as Showpiece
- Projector mode makes tournaments look professional
- Photography-worthy for social media

#### 5. Professional Output as Product
- PDFs represent the dojang's professionalism
- Print-ready without adjustments
- No watermarks on free tier

---

### UX Friction Metric

> "% of users who complete first tournament using only mouse clicks"

- If users can do everything without shortcuts, defaults are working
- Keyboard shortcuts are power-user enhancements, not requirements

---

### Emotional Design Principles

#### 1. Relief Over Delight
> "First, remove stress. Then add polish."

Our users aren't looking for entertainment — they're escaping spreadsheet hell. Relief is the primary emotion; delight is a bonus.

#### 2. Confidence Through Visibility
> "Show them it's working, even when they're not looking."

- Autosave indicators ("Saved just now")
- Progress states ("3 of 6 divisions complete")
- Confirmation messages ("Athletes sorted into 4 divisions")

#### 3. Forgiveness by Default
> "Every mistake has a one-click fix."

- Undo is always available
- Destructive actions require confirmation
- Nothing is permanent until exported/shared

#### 4. Professional Pride
> "Make them look good to their community."

- Output quality reflects on the dojang
- Every parent-facing element is polished
- Venue display mode is a showpiece

#### 5. Calm Over Excitement
> "Tournament day is already stressful. We are the calm."

- No flashing alerts or urgent UI
- Muted, professional color palette
- Clear, predictable interactions

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern                    | Why It's Bad                     | Seen In              | TKD Brackets Alternative              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

### Design Inspiration Strategy

#### What to ADOPT (Use Directly)

| Pattern                                  | Why                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Keyboard shortcuts for power actions** | Scorers need speed            |
| **Autosave with visible indicator**      | Tournament reliability        |
| **Optimistic updates**                   | Feel instant                  |
| **Undo snackbar**                        | Forgiveness over confirmation |
| **Card-based dashboard**                 | Clear tournament organization |

#### What to ADAPT (Modify for Our Needs)

| Pattern               | Original                | Adaptation                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Command palette**   | Complex, many commands  | Simplified: 5-10 common actions     |
| **Canvas navigation** | Figma's full complexity | Just zoom/pan for brackets          |
| **Inline editing**    | Airtable's full system  | Limited to athlete details only     |
| **Dark mode**         | Full theme system       | Venue display mode only (initially) |

#### What to AVOID

| Pattern                           | Why                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Setup wizards**                 | Demo-first approach instead     |
| **Feature tours**                 | Contextual hints only           |
| **Account-required before value** | Pre-signup demo                 |
| **Modal confirmations**           | Undo pattern instead            |
| **Complex role management**       | Simple invite with preset roles |

## Defining Core Experience

### The Defining Experience

> **"Paste your roster → Watch athletes magically sort into correctly seeded brackets"**

This is the **"Aha! Moment"** — the core interaction that users will describe to friends:

*"I literally just pasted my spreadsheet and it generated TKD brackets with proper dojang separation. In like 30 seconds."*

### User Mental Model

#### How Users Currently Solve This

| Current Approach             | Mental Model                              | Pain Point            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Excel Spreadsheets**       | "I build it myself cell by cell"          | 2+ hours, error-prone |
| **Generic Bracket Tools**    | "I need to manually configure everything" | No TKD knowledge      |
| **Paper Brackets**           | "I draw it by hand"                       | Can't handle changes  |
| **Specialized TKD Software** | "Expensive, complex, overkill"            | Not accessible        |

#### User Expectations vs. Reality

| User Expectation                          | TKD Brackets Reality                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "I'll need to configure federation rules" | We know WT/ITF/ATA already            |
| "I'll manually assign divisions"          | Athletes auto-sort by age/weight/belt |
| "I'll have to place byes carefully"       | Optimal bye placement automatic       |
| "Same dojang might face each other early" | Dojang separation built-in            |

#### Confusion Prevention

| Confusion Point                           | Prevention Strategy                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "Did it correctly apply the rules?"       | Show confirmation messages for each rule applied |
| "What if it made a mistake?"              | Easy override for any automatic decision         |
| "Will this work for my federation?"       | Federation selection upfront, rules visible      |
| "Can I trust this before tournament day?" | Preview everything before generating             |

### Novel UX Patterns

#### Pattern Strategy

| Pattern Type          | Where Applied                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Established**       | Drag-and-drop, bracket visualization, data tables |
| **Established**       | Paste to import (Airtable, Google Sheets)         |
| **Novel Combination** | Domain intelligence + one-click generation        |
| **Novel**             | TKD-specific auto-categorization                  |

#### Our Innovation

We apply **domain intelligence** to established patterns:

| Established Pattern  | Our Innovation                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Paste from clipboard | + Column auto-detection for TKD data  |
| Data categorization  | + Federation-aware weight/age classes |
| Bracket generation   | + Dojang separation algorithms        |
| PDF export           | + Tournament-official formatting      |

#### User Education Required

**Minimal** — familiar patterns throughout:
- Paste works like spreadsheets
- Preview/generate works like document tools
- Bracket editing works like drag-and-drop
- Export works like print-to-PDF

**Trust-building needed:** Users burned by generic tools may want to verify manually at first — confidence-building UI essential.

### Experience Mechanics

#### 1. Initiation

| Element          | Design                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Entry Point**  | "Create Tournament" button on dashboard |
| **First Prompt** | "Paste your roster OR upload a file"    |
| **Mental Model** | "Just like copying from Excel"          |
| **Alternative**  | Manual entry for small (< 8) rosters    |

#### 2. The Import

| Step               | System Response                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| User pastes roster | Instant parsing with column detection          |
| Columns identified | "Found: Name, Dojang, Age, Weight, Belt"       |
| Ambiguous column   | "Is this 'Weight' or 'Division'?" (inline fix) |
| Confirmation       | "32 athletes imported from 8 dojangs"          |

#### 3. The Magic (Division Building)

| Step                          | System Response                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| User clicks "Build Divisions" | Smart Division Builder activates               |
| System analyzes roster        | "Analyzing for WT rules..."                    |
| Divisions proposed            | "6 divisions identified"                       |
| Each division shows           | "Junior Boys -45kg: 8 athletes from 4 dojangs" |
| Edge cases flagged            | "1 athlete doesn't fit standard divisions"     |

#### 4. Bracket Generation

| Step                            | System Response                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| User clicks "Generate Brackets" | < 500ms generation                               |
| Animation shows                 | Brackets build visually (satisfying)             |
| Confirmation message            | "6 brackets created. Dojang separation applied." |
| Bracket view opens              | Pan/zoom interactive bracket                     |

#### 5. Feedback Throughout

| Situation | Feedback                                                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Success   | Toast: "8 athletes sorted into Junior Boys -45kg"                            |
| Warning   | Yellow badge: "1 bye in this bracket"                                        |
| Issue     | Inline alert: "Two athletes from same dojang may meet in Round 2 — [Adjust]" |
| Autosave  | Corner indicator: "Saved just now"                                           |

#### 6. Completion

| Element       | Design                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Success state | "🏆 Tournament Ready — 6 divisions, 32 athletes" |
| Next action   | "Export PDF" or "Open Scoring Mode"             |
| Return point  | Dashboard shows tournament card with status     |

### Accessibility Considerations

#### Color Accessibility

| Requirement            | Implementation                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **WCAG AA (4.5:1)**    | All text passes; verified in color system       |
| **WCAG AAA (7:1)**     | Body text on backgrounds passes                 |
| **Color Independence** | Never rely on color alone (use icons, patterns) |
| **High Contrast Mode** | Support system high contrast preferences        |

#### Focus & Navigation

| Requirement             | Implementation                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Focus Indicators**    | 2px solid outline on focus          |
| **Tab Order**           | Logical, follows visual hierarchy   |
| **Skip Links**          | Skip to main content link           |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | All actions accessible via keyboard |

#### Screen Reader Support

| Requirement       | Implementation                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Semantic HTML** | Proper heading hierarchy, landmarks  |
| **ARIA Labels**   | All interactive elements labeled     |
| **Live Regions**  | Score updates announced              |
| **Alt Text**      | All images have descriptive alt text |

#### Motion & Animation

| Requirement         | Implementation                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Reduced Motion**  | Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`       |
| **Duration Limits** | Animations < 500ms                     |
| **No Flashing**     | No flashing content (seizure risk)     |
| **Purpose**         | Animations add meaning, not decoration |

## Design Direction Decision

### Design Directions Explored

Six distinct visual directions were explored, each applying the established visual foundation differently:

| Direction                       | Approach                             | Personality                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **1. Clean Professional**       | Conservative, trustworthy, corporate | "Reliable business software"       |
| **2. Sports Energy**            | Bold, dynamic, competitive           | "ESPN meets tournament management" |
| **3. Focused Minimalist**       | Ultra-minimal, zen-like calm         | "Notion meets tournament brackets" |
| **4. Dashboard Command Center** | Information-dense, control           | "Mission control for tournaments"  |
| **5. Friendly Approachable**    | Warm, rounded, welcoming             | "Slack meets tournament brackets"  |
| **6. Hybrid Professional**      | Balanced combination                 | "Professional tool with TKD soul"  |

---

### Chosen Direction

**Direction 6: Hybrid Professional** — A balanced combination approach that adapts visual personality based on context.

#### Context-Based Design

| Context           | Visual Approach                   | Source          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Dashboard**     | Clean card grid, generous spacing | Direction 1     |
| **Bracket View**  | Bold canvas with zoom/pan         | Direction 2 + 4 |
| **Scoring Mode**  | Minimal focus UI, keyboard-first  | Direction 3     |
| **Venue Display** | Dark sports energy, high-contrast | Direction 2     |
| **Onboarding**    | Friendly tooltips, welcoming      | Direction 5     |

---

### Design Rationale

| Decision Factor          | Why Hybrid Professional                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional Alignment**  | "Relief Over Delight" principle — calm foundation with strategic excitement  |
| **Organizer Needs**      | Professional appearance builds Master Kim's credibility with parents         |
| **Volunteer Simplicity** | Focus mode (Direction 3 elements) reduces Mrs. Rodriguez's anxiety           |
| **Spectator Appeal**     | Venue display mode (Direction 2 elements) creates photography-worthy screens |
| **Flexibility**          | Room to evolve toward either more professional or more energetic             |

#### Key Visual Decisions

| Element           | Decision                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cards**         | Medium rounded corners (8px), subtle elevation, clear borders    |
| **Navigation**    | Collapsible sidebar, contextual actions, breadcrumbs             |
| **Density**       | Medium — comfortable for volunteers, efficient for organizers    |
| **Color Balance** | Navy for key elements, gold for success/accent, neutral surfaces |
| **Typography**    | Clean hierarchy, tabular figures for scores                      |

### Journey Patterns

#### Navigation Pattern: Progressive Focus

```
Overview → Selection → Detail → Action → Confirmation → Return
```

All journeys follow this consistent pattern for predictability.

#### Feedback Pattern: Layered Confirmation

| Layer             | Example             | Timing         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| **Immediate**     | Button press visual | 0ms            |
| **Toast**         | "Score saved"       | 100ms          |
| **Visual Update** | Bracket animation   | 200-500ms      |
| **Persistent**    | Autosave indicator  | Always visible |

#### Error Pattern: Inline Recovery

| Principle   | Implementation                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Prevent** | Validation before action           |
| **Detect**  | Immediate feedback on issues       |
| **Recover** | Undo always available              |
| **Learn**   | Contextual help on repeated errors |
