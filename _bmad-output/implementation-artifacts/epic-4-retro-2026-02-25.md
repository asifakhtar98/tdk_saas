# Epic 4 Retrospective: Participant Management

## Epic Summary

* Epic 4 reviewed: Bulk import, duplicate detection, participant status management, auto assignment algorithms are well developed.
* Almost all stories completed except a final review for manual participant entry.

## Code Validation
* Duplicate detection correctly uses Levenshtein distance matching metrics for CSV records.
* The tests correctly identify CSV header permutations without breaking `CsvImportParser`.

## Key Insights & Action Items

* Participant feature structure was complex due to parsing varied real-world data issues.
* **Blockers Encountered:** `ParticipantListBloc` injected with 8 parameters where 6 were expected, showing `getIt` parameter limits or DI config caching issues. Resolved via `build_runner` re-configuration.
* **Architecture Win:** Central duplicate detection algorithms isolated from parsing infrastructure makes data cleanliness testable.
* **Action Item:** We must finalize `ManualParticipantEntry` UI elements before considering the entire Epic seamlessly integrated into UI workflows.

## Preparation for Next Epic (Epic 5: Bracket Generation)
* Since bracket generation strictly requires clear, assigned participant divisions, Epic 4's `AssignParticipantsToDivisions` use-case is vital.
* Blockers for Epic 5 kick-off include getting full `done` status on manual entry mechanisms to handle missing or one-off registrants smoothly.
