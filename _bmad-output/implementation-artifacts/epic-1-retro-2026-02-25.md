# Epic 1 Retrospective: Foundation & Demo Mode

## Epic Summary

* Epic 1 completed: All 12 stories successfully implemented.
* Core architecture, database, dependency injection, routing, error handling, Sync and Autosave concepts, and demo mode established.

## Code Validation
* Test Suite: Validated. All tests for data layer, use cases, and app routing pass cleanly.

## Key Insights & Action Items

* The foundation components were set up robustly.
* **Architecture Validation:** Drift for SQLite combined with riverpod/bloc state definitions works well.
* **Blockers:** Found none during the initial epic, but we have to ensure Sync service isn't overly complex moving forward.
* **Action Item:** Make sure test coverage remains high in subsequent features as the architecture is heavily dependent on the established boilerplate.

## Preparation for Next Epic (Epic 2)

* Epic 2 requires user authentication and organization models. They have been implemented cleanly.
