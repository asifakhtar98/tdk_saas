# Epic 3 Retrospective: Tournament & Division Management

## Epic Summary

* Epic 3 essentially finished: All division creation, tournament management, and ring assignment stories have passed development and review phase.
* Smart Division Builder Algorithm established effectively, along with federation templates.

## Code Validation
* Full testing of the `TournamentRepository` and `DivisionRepository` alongside their use-cases `CreateTournamentUseCase`, `DuplicateTournamentAsTemplateUseCase` validates that tournament creation and template processing are successful.

## Key Insights & Action Items

* The Smart Division Builder effectively reduces manual work in creating standard divisions.
* **Blockers Encountered:** Division merge and split feature took some extra logic testing (Story 3-11), requiring the system to handle participants shifting gracefully.
* **Architecture Win:** Centralizing the `SchedulingConflictDetection` logic saved us from duplicating temporal constraint violations.
* **Action Item:** Ensure any newly merged division continues to enforce age+weight brackets properly so we avoid data corruption issues during generation in later epics.

## Preparation for Next Epic (Epic 4, Participant Management)
* Epic 4's Participant entity depends highly on how divisions are modeled.
* The structure established here for divisions sets up `AssignParticipantsToDivisions` perfectly.
